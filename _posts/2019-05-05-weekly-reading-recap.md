# Weekly Reading Recap – May 5, 2019

### Death by PowerPoint: the slide that killed seven people

> In all with bullet points and indents six levels of hierarchy were created. This allowed NASA managers to imply a hierarchy of importance in their head: the writing lower down and in smaller font was ignored. Actually, this had been where the contradictory (and most important) information was placed.

Of course PowerPoint the software itself is not to blame, but this illustrates how the choices made in presenting information drastically impacts how others perceive the information.


### Cap Watkins on Design Leadership, Critique and Finding Your Path

> How do you know what’s next? That list from your previous company is a good starting point. If you were looking for a role with more accountability, you should go find that. If you were looking for more money, a more mature product development process, a manager who will help you grow… write those things down and look for that in the companies you interview with. Craft questions for the interviewers that help you figure out if that company will give you what you’re looking for.

Cap also goes into the challenges of distributed teams, and recommends against it. As someone who is highly interested in working for a fully distributed team I was a bit discouraged by this, but more-so appreciate the reasons he went into about it.

Even more interesting, [Cap just announced he’s joining Primary](https://twitter.com/cap/status/1127940078242758656) and closing down his coaching company he started just a few short months ago — a good reminder that all of the advice we give one another is from the journey, as we have not yet reached our final destination.


### Want Better UX? Change the Conversation.

> The next time somebody introduces a UX project by asking for a specific deliverable or by giving vague instructions to “make it better,” you need to change the conversation.

It seems obvious, but this situation has a way of creeping back in, even in with teams that know better.


### What’s Wrong with Dot Voting Exercises

> The value of dot voting is as a discussion tool, not a tool for making decisions.

Stephen Anderson brings up a lot of valid points on the negative effects of dot voting and examples of when dot voting is not appropriate. I especially liked that he points dot voting shouldn’t be done when the items being voted on are a mix and problems and solutions rather than solutions to a single problem.
