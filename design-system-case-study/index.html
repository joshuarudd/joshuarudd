      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>With rapid team growth and a transition towards multiple autonomous feature teams, how might UserVoice continue to deliver cohesive and consistent experiences across its broad platform?</p>
      <p>For years UserVoice had remained relatively small and didn’t have much turnover. It had been relatively easy to keep things consistent and for everyone to be on the same page. However, as we began to grow and feature development divided between multiple cross-functional teams, it quickly became apparent we needed to a better way to scale our teams while keeping our platform cohesive and consistent.</p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Empower cross-functional teams to autonomously deliver new features while increasing overall cohesiveness of the platform.</li>
        <li>Speed up feature delivery.</li>
        <li>Increase shared understanding, camaraderie, and trust within the design team.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
      <p>We hypothesized that if we codified our design system and processes, we could reduce… speed up design and delivery cycles as well as increase understanding of design decisions.</p>

      <blockquote cite="https://tannerchristensen.com/blog/2019/1/30/building-design-systems-at-scale">
        <p>“A healthy design system will make easier to scale design patterns and components alongside a growing design team. It will ensure consistency and quality across all experiences, and increase the speed as well as creativity of designers without losing best practices or consistency within the product.”</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Constraints</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>We had no dedicated Design Ops or tools team to create and maintain the system.</li>
        <li>Proposed changes to existing designs could only be applied through other feature releases.</li>
        <li>The solution must be easily maintained and amendable by others.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Roles</h3>
      <p>As director of user experience, I facilitated the design system initiative, captured and refined the processes the team came up with, and delivered the created artifacts in a format quickly accessible to all teams within the company. The entire design team, product team, and an engineers from each team contributed to design system throughout the initiative.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Process</h2>

      <h3>Layer 1: Design Principles</h3>
      <p>It’s always tempting to start at the end first—in this case, creating a bunch of styled UI components and usage guidelines—but we quickly learned that we needed to agree upon our design principles to guide the process and output of work being done.</p>
      <p>To start, each member of the design team did their own research and compiled ideas for our design principles. We then came together to share, find similarities and differences between them, and discuss which ones interested us most as a team. I then took these and compiled a single Google document, combining and incorporating the ideas that resonated most.</p>
      <p>At this point we had about two dozen principles—way more than we needed! Through a couple of follow-up discussions—both in person and via comments on the doc—and some heavy editing, we were able to narrow them down to four primary design principles (each had additional notes and examples):</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Familiarity:</strong> UserVoice feels familiar, and matches people’s mental model and experience with other platforms and interfaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> People understand where they are, what they can do, and what has happened.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Stay out of people’s way and help them get their job done as efficiently as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency and Structure:</strong> The look, feel, and behavior of our platform is consistent with itself.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now we had something that could guide our design decisions.</p>

      <h3>Layer 2: Design Patterns</h3>
      <p>As with any product that exists in the world, there were already countless inconsistencies across the UserVoice platform—such as how to display date and time formats, capitalization rules, and form validation and behavior. Each time a feature team set out to tackle a new problem, the same questions would come up: How should we format this? and How should this behave?</p>
      <p>To address this, we set out to describe UserVoice’s design patterns. Similar to software design patterns, these were not specific visual styles or implementation details, but rather formalized best practices describing how to solve common and repeated problems in many different situations—universal quality criteria for broad design mental models, content, and behavior. (In contrast, the component library detailed product-specific styles and implementation of these patterns.)</p>
      <p>One example is Forms & Validation, which describes best practices, proper use of labels, validation behavior for fields and submit buttons, keyboard controls, and other accessibility requirements.</p>
      <p>[Example design pattern: Forms & Validation]</p>
      <p>Additional patterns included Capitalization, Confirmations, Date & Timestamps, Flash Messages, Keyboard Controls, Hidden & Disabled Features, Page Titles, Undo, and more.</p>
      <p>Unlike our design principles, which were finite and less likely to change as often, our set of design patterns were a much larger set of living documents. Because of this, the design team committed to defining patterns over the course of several months as part of their ongoing work. For example, when a project called for a form, if there wasn’t already a “Forms and Validation” pattern document, the designer and I would work together to document existing form patterns and behaviors and refine them as necessary. The next time a form was created, the feature team could reference the existing “Forms and Validation” design pattern.</p>

      <h3>Layer 3: Component Library</h3>
      <p>With our principles and process for documenting patterns in place, our next challenge was to unify our visual design toolbox, or component library. Because each application (e.g., Admin Console, Sidebar, Widget, etc.) targeted different audiences, contexts and had different styles, we created separate libraries for each.</p>
      <p>For the previous 6 years at UserVoice mockups had been primarily designed with Adobe Illustrator. Sometimes designers would share files with each other to reuse the same objects someone else had created (buttons, menus, dialogs, etc.), but there was no central management, and oftentimes it was easier for each person to recreate these on the fly, creating small inconsistencies between each designer. If someone needed a form field, they created it from scratch, trying to make it look like the others. This resulted in an inconsistent and incomplete set of components to work from, and often led to developers wondering how representative the designs were to how they should actually be implemented.</p>
      <p>By 2016 Sketch had not only gained the admiration of designers everywhere, its performance, nested symbol handling, and transition to using single files (rather than packaged contents) finally made the switch from Illustrator very compelling. Still, we had to figure out how might we create a source of truth for our common components and make it really easy for designers to both use and contribute to the component library. This was still long before Sketch had released external symbol library files.</p>

      <h4>Creating a Source of Truth</h4>
      <p>We tried both Git and Dropbox, but quickly dropped Git because it didn’t handle binary files very efficiently. The challenge with Dropbox was that there was no clear way for multiple people to contribute to the same library without running into conflicts, and it still didn’t solve the problem of ensuring everyone’s separate design projects were using the same components. We also tried creating a component library project with InVision, which we’d already been using since 2011, and using its source files sync, but that was even more cumbersome than Dropbox.</p>
      <p>[Image of multiple versions of component library files in Dropbox]</p>
      <p>Fortunately, along came Abstract App, a new Git-like version control system for Sketch files. In November 2016 we began testing the private alpha, and committed to adopted it starting January 2017. With Abstract, we were able to create a different project (repository) for each of our primary applications. Each project consisted of a single Sketch file that contained all the symbols necessary for that application’s component library (again, this was before Sketch introduced external symbol library files).</p>
      <p>Each time a designer began working on a new project, they’d create a new branch based off the Master file and go to town. All the symbols/components they needed to work from were available in their file. When any components were updated in the Master file during the life of a designer’s project, they could easily pull in those changes to their working file and all of the components would be updated to reflect the source of truth. Likewise, any new or modified components they worked on would become available to everyone else once their work was completed. Finally, we had all the benefits our developers had with Git. As with our design patterns, the team committed to building out the component library alongside existing projects.</p>
      <p>[Image of form fields components]</p>
      <p>An unexpected benefit of having full version control of our component library with Abstract was that changes and conflicts were easy to track, discuss, and resolve (if necessary). In addition to our regular critiques, when a designer’s project was ready to merge back into Master the whole team would come together for a design merge ceremony to review changes to the component library. It kept everyone mentally in sync of how each designer’s work would affect the others’.</p>

      <h3>Pulling it all together</h3>
      <p>So where did we publish and share our design philosophy, patterns, and component libraries?</p>
      <p><mark>Documentation is only useful if the people it is intended for know about it, reference it, and it remains relevant.</mark> Since the audience for these were primarily designers and developers, it needed to be somewhere both parties would remember to access it.</p>
      <p>After some informal discussions, I came up with this list of must-haves:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Available to anyone at the company</li>
        <li>Easy to search, browse and link to specific documentation</li>
        <li>Easy for designers to update and maintain</li>
        <li>Changes can be tracked</li>
        <li>People can be notified of changes and additions</li>
      </ol>
      <p>At first we tried using an internal Github project, but the learning curve for some designers was a bit high. Google Docs was commonplace, but notoriously difficult for people to find and discover things. After a few months, the engineering team began using Confluence for some of their own documentation, so we quickly adopted it for documenting, discussing, and refining design patterns as well.</p>

      <h4>Shared documents are not shared understanding</h4>
      <p>I’m also a firm believer in Jeff Patton’s saying, “Shared documents are not shared understanding.” [1] Essentially, just because you write something down and share it, it doesn’t mean the audience will understand it, agree with it, remember it, or even read it. Communication and understanding require much more than a document, so saying, “Well, it’s documented in the design system!” isn’t an excuse. Understanding happens through conversation and, as Patton also says, “By the time you get tired of saying something, others are just beginning to hear it.” Essentially, we couldn’t rely on documentation along to cultivate a shared understanding of our design system.</p>
      <p>To address this, we had to make habits of discussing …</p>

      <h2>Outcomes</h2>

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>Our vision is to create a cohesive user experience that unites the UserVoice platform across development teams, applications, and devices. The UserVoice Design System is where you’ll find the guidance needed to build upon the UserVoice ecosystem using our design principles, design patterns, and established components. As a living set of documents, this design system will be updated as our platform evolves.</p>

      <h3>Processes</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Weekly design merge ceremony</li>
        <li>Weekly design critiques</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Artifacts</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Design Principles</li>
        <li>Design Patterns</li>
        <li>Component Library</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Did use Google Sheets for some Truth Sheets.</p>

      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Separating design patterns from the styled components helped us separate form from function, making it much easier to update our styles and components over time, and apply different ones to different applications—much like how CSS can apply radically different styles to well formed HTML without changing the structure of the content.</li>
        <li>No design system or process is perfect. While having a design system helps reduce the number of decisions that need to be made, it is not infallible. New problems and challenges can’t always be solved with existing solutions, so it’s important to recognize when …</li>
        <li>Our fourth design principle, Consistency and Structure, became a major point of contention during early design critiques. Doing or using something once does not make it a pattern, and our conversations often veered towards making designs consistent with other things we’ve designed rather than, as Jared Spool posed, “Will the user’s current knowledge help them understand how to use what I’m designing?” Next time I’d push for removing “consistency” from the design principles, and focused more on Familiarity, with an emphasis on the user’s current knowledge, or “sum of all their previous experiences with relevant products and designs.” [2]</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Ideas for future iterations</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Find ways for tighter integration between coded components and design prototypes - UXPin’s forthcoming “Merge” functionality seems particularly interesting.</li>
      </ol>
